Junkyard Crane Operator

Welcome to your new position at East Grestin Junkyard.
New technology has been discovered that can erase matter
and energy from existence. We have decided to start using
this technology to get rid of waste and pollution.
You will be using the crane to lower cubed garbage into
the machine. Once the garbage makes a connection between
both walls of the machine, it will be erased from existence.
However, don't let the garbage pile up, or your pay will be
docked by three quarters as it is quite costly to clean the machine.
